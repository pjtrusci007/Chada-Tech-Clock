# Clock

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

# What did you do particularly well?
During this project, the area where I did particularly well was in using comments effectively to make sure I relayed what the purpose of a function was.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The area where I could use improvement was in using variables that have meaning. For example, when I have integers such as p, n, etc. it makes it difficult for others to understand what each variable is refering to especially when looking over a function.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The biggest challenge for me during this project was definitely functionality. I remember I had a tough time trying to figure out how to make each part work together towards the desired result. I spent the majority of the time rewriting code whereas if I sat down and wrote what I needed to do and section each problem into smaller problems I would have reached the result I wanted much quicker.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The biggest takeaway from this project has to be pseudocode as well as learning that you need to have a plan as well as a way to dissect the project into smaller parts.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In order to make this program more readable, I limited the line length; maintainable by deploying stark comments.
